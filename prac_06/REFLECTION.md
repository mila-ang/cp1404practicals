# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Iâ€™ve started using more structured planning and breaking down each task into smaller steps, which helps me manage my time better and understand the problem more clearly. This approach also allows me to focus on one step at a time, making it less overwhelming and helping me identify potential issues earlier.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to work on my consistency in practicing coding outside of class assignments. Spending regular, focused time on programming exercises each week could strengthen my understanding and help me apply concepts more quickly. Additionally, I want to improve my focus by minimizing distractions and dedicating uninterrupted blocks of time to each practical.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am doing well at seeking feedback and reviewing my code for improvements, which has helped me learn from mistakes and refine my coding style. I also document my work clearly, which not only helps me but also makes my code easier to understand for others.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating on practical tasks and underestimating the time required to complete them. Sometimes I delay starting an exercise, thinking it will take less time than it actually does. I plan to address this by starting assignments earlier, even if it's just outlining steps or initial thoughts.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

One change I would suggest is more real-world project-based assessments that integrate multiple skills learned throughout the semester. It would be beneficial to have a project that simulates a real-world application, requiring planning, coding, testing, and documentation as a more comprehensive assessment. This would help us better understand how these skills fit together in actual IT roles.
