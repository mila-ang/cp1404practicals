# CP1404 Practicals

## About This Repository
This repository contains my work for CP1404, focusing on programming practices learned throughout the course. Here, I explore key concepts related to clean code, object-oriented programming, and design principles. 

## 3 Clean Code Lessons Learned
1. Readability and Naming Conventions: Consistently using descriptive and clear names for variables, classes, and methods makes the code much easier to understand and maintain.
2. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle): Structuring code so that each class or function has a specific, single purpose helps avoid complexity and makes testing and debugging easier.
3. DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoiding duplicate code by using functions, loops, and reusable components prevents redundancy and reduces the chance of bugs.
